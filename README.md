# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! This repository showcases projects that apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning techniques** to solve real-world problems.

---

## 📌 Introduction
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform **data cleaning** and **statistical summarization**.
- Apply **EDA techniques** to uncover insights.
- Build and evaluate **machine learning models**.
- Create **visualizations** using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
